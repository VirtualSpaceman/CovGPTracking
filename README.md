# Visual Tracking combining Region Covariancewith Gaussian Process Prediction

[Paper](http://cbic2017.org/papers/cbic-paper-103.pdf)

``Abstract: This work implements a video tracking method which combines  region  covariance  detection  with  motion  estimation  by  GaussianProcess Regression. The computational and accuracy performance of the proposed method is compared to two other state-of-the-art algorithms available in OpenCV using benchmark videos from the VOT public challenges. The results show that the method is competitive and can be usedin the construction of practical applications in several contexts of videosurveillance.``

# Test time!
Example of our proposed method running in one video available in VOT database. =)
